## 3. Database Setup Instructions
The application uses a MongoDB database with three main collections: Users, Journeys, and JourneyDetails. Below are the schemas and sample data for each collection.
### (1) User Schema
The `UserSchema` defines each user's structure, including their username, password, profile picture, and associated journeys.

```javascript
const UserSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
    userName: {
        type: String,
        required: true,
        unique: true
    },
    password: {
        type: String,
        required: true
    },
    profilePicture: {
        type: String,
        default: ''
    },
    journeys: [{
        type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId,
        ref: 'Journeys'
    }]
}, { collection: 'Users' });
```
#### Sample User Data
```json
{
    "_id":{"$oid":"672ea2402753b7432afe6308"},
    "userName":"Alice",
    "password":"password123",
    "profilePicture":"https://example.com/profiles/alice.jpg",
    "journeys":[{"$oid":"672ea18af3572752638a95f2"},{"$oid":"672ea18af3572752638a95f3"}]
}
```


### (2) Journey Schema
The JourneySchema defines the title of a journey, the user who created it, and references to associated details.
```javascript
const JourneySchema = new mongoose.Schema({
    title: {
        type: String,
        required: true
    },
    details: [{
        type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId,
        ref: 'JourneyDetails'
    }],
    userName: {
        type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId,
        ref: 'Users'
    }
}, { collection: 'Journeys' });
```
#### Sample Journey Data
```json
{
    "_id":{"$oid":"672ea18af3572752638a95f2"},
    "title":"Wonderful Summer Vacation",
    "details":[{"$oid":"672e9e8c95993cdc1506605c"},{"$oid":"672e9e8c95993cdc1506605d"}],
    "userName":{"$oid":"672ea2402753b7432afe6308"}
}
```


### (3) Journey Details Schema
The JourneyDetailsSchema defines specific journey entries with time, location, journal text, and photos.
```javascript
const JourneyDetailsSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
    time: {
        type: Date,
        required: true
    },
    location: {
        type: {
            type: String,
            default: 'Point'
        },
        coordinates: {
            type: [Number],
            required: true
        }
    },
    journalText: {
        type: String,
        required: true
    },
    journalPhoto: {
        type: String,
        required: false
    },
    journeyId: {
        type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId,
        ref: 'Journeys',
        required: true
    }
}, { collection: 'JourneyDetails' });
```

#### Sample Journey Details Data
```json
{
    "_id":{"$oid":"672e9e8c95993cdc1506605d"},
    "time":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1710756000000"}},
    "location":{
        "type":"Point",
        "coordinates":[{"$numberDouble":"121.4737"},{"$numberDouble":"31.2304"}]
    },
    "journalText":"an update record in San Jose",
    "journalPhoto":"http://example.com/updated-photo.jpg",
    "journeyId":{"$oid":"672ea18af3572752638a95f2"}
}
```
